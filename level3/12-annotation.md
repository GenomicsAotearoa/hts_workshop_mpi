# Annotation of sequences

* Teaching: 30 minutes
* Exercises: 30 minutes

#### Objectives

* Understand the differences betweem nucleotide and protein sequence matching
* Be aware of which publicly available databases are appropriate for which data
* Learn how to submit `BLAST` jobs to the NeSI cluster using `slurm`

#### Keypoints

* Annotation is required in order to identify the function and origin of sequences obtaining from HTS analysis
* There are different databases available for annotation and classification
* Interpreting the results of BLAST alignments can be a tricky process
  * Understand the meanings of the identity, coverage, e-value, and bitscore metrics when assessing a BLAST output
