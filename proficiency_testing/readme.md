### Proficiency testing for MPI HTS workshops 

In this series of workshops we have covered a broad introduction to bioinformatics skills, learnt about a variety of different tools and applied these to answer diagnostic questions relavent to each discipline here at PHEL. 

In order to showcase how far we have all come, its time for the much anticipated final project (or proficiency test) 

A final project has been created for each team in order to closely replicate the HTS processes of that team during routine diagnostic work, for example the Entomology team will need to use sequencing data to diagnose an insect pest. 

For each project you will: 
- use the bioinformatics skills you have developed to navigate around NeSI, copy, move and interact with files
- demonstrate your ability to use the NeSI platform to load and use bioinformatic tools 
- write a slurm script to perform the necessary analysis 
- diagnose a discipline specific plant pathogen
