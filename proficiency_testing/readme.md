# Proficiency testing for HTS workshops 

In this series of workshops we have covered a broad introduction to bioinformatics skills, learnt about a variety of different tools and applied these to answer diagnostic questions relavent to each discipline here at PHEL. 

In order to showcase how far we have all come, its time for the much anticipated final project (or proficiency test) 

A final project has been created for each team in order to closely replicate the HTS processes of that team during routine diagnostic work, for example the Entomology team will need to use sequencing data to identify an insect species through sequence analysis. 

#### Objectives

For each project you will: 

* Use the bioinformatics skills you have developed to navigate around NeSI, copy, move and interact with files to create a logically organised, easy to follow, analysis folder.
* Demonstrate your ability to use the NeSI platform to identify relevant bioinformatic tools and load them
* Write `slurm` scripts to deploy jobs to the cluster, with appropriate resource usage, to perform the necessary analysis 
* Evaluate the findings of your analysis, to complete a set of discipline-specific tasks  

The due date for your completed analysis is <TO BE DETERMINED>.

## Housekeeping

Before beginning your work, please keep in mind the following considerations:

1. As this work is considered training, please ensure that you use the `nesi03181` project code for submitting all `slurm` jobs, not the MPI diagnostic project.
1. There is no expectation of a particualr folder structure or file layout for this assessment, but do your best to keep your work well organised and easy to follow, as you would for any other work.
1. We will be primarily using your `slurm` scripts to assess your profficiency with the tools that you have used, so please make sure that these are easy to locate.
1. During the time for this assessment, you will have **_limited_** ability to consult with the trainers for assistance in scheduled meetings. Please respect our time and use these times for questions and help.
1. Remember that this is an assessment of your ability, which includes the ability to troubleshoot issues. We will provide limited assistance but will not be fixing errors that we find.
1. Do not leave this until the last minute! Some of the jobs you will need to perform may take several hours of compute time so cannot be run on the last day. Similarly, you will need time to assess and verify your findings so make sure that you leave sufficient time to do so.
