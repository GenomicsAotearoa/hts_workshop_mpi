# Introduction to NeSI HPC Platforms

* Teaching: 20 minutes
* Exercises: 10 minutes

#### Objectives

* Write and submit a `BLAST` job to the NeSI compute cluster using the `slurm` system

#### Keypoints

* NeSI uses a login node (`lander`) to submit large computational tasks to the `mahuika` and `maui` clusters.
* Computational resources are requested and provisioned using the `slurm` management system.
* Pre-installed software can be accessed using the `module load` command.
