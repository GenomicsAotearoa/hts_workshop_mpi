## Introduction to Bioinformatic Workflow Managers
  
  
With the rapid advancement of sequencing technologies and the increase in large-scale genomic datasets, analysis often requires numerous tools, custom and established scripts, and data processing steps, which can lead to challenges in reproducibility, scalability, and efficiency.  

To address these issues, bioinformaticians and computational biologists have turned to workflow managers to streamline data analysis and computational pipelines. Two popular workflow managers in the bioinformatics community are **Snakemake** and **Nextflow**.

A workflow manager automates and manages the execution of a series of steps in an analysis workflow providing a systematic and reproducible approach to data analysis. An example workflow may include data pre-processing, quality control, assembly, alignment, variant calling or BLAST analysis, and visualization.


Some key advantages of workflow managers include: 

•	Management of software dependencies through use of NeSI modules  
•	Automated parallelization and resource management across multiple cores allowing easy scaling from small to large datasets  
•	Workflows are explicitly defined, including software versions and parameters. This improves reproducibility both internally and by collaborators or other users.   

Both Snakemake and Nextflow are popular in the bioinformatics community and both have many online resources and active user communities to support their use. Snakemake is implemented in python, while Nextflow is built around reactive programming and supports many different scripting languages. Determining which workflow manager to use, Snakemake or Nextflow, depends on specific requirements, preferences, and the context of the project. 

In this module we will be learning how to build a simple workflow in Nextflow that will do X Y Z
